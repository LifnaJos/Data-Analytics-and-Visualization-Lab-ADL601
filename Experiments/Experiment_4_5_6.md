# Experiments : 
- Exp. 4 : Time Series Analysis in Python
- Exp. 5 : Implementation of ARIMA model in python
- Exp. 6 : Implementation of Time series Decomposition and ACF and PACF
## Lab Outcomes (LO):
* Build various time series models on a given data set. (LO3)
## Task to be performed :
1. Refer the Google Colab Notebook for [Times Series Analysis using Python](https://github.com/LifnaJos/ADC601-Data-Analytics-Visualization/blob/main/M3_DAV.ipynb)
2. Select a Time Series Data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/?search=Time+series)
3. Experiment the data with the code from the Google Colab and derive meaningful conclusions from your dataset
4. Prepare a Colab Notebook with the Aim, Tasks performed, Program, Output, and Conclusion and upload the Notebook in your Github Repositiry.
5. Prepare a handwritten wrtieup with Aim, Theory and Conclusion.

## Tools & Libraries to be explored
* Python Libraries: statsmodels, matplotlib, numpy, pandas,math, sklearn,pmdarima

## Theory to be written:
1. Significance of Time Series 
2. Components of Time Series Data
3. Difference between Additive and Multiplicative Decomposition
